Citing your contributions for scholarly credit.
------------------
If you make a substantial update, we encourage you to submie a summary of the update for publication in an academic journal ([example](http://pubmed.gov/25164526)). Suggested approaches:
users could simply link in their curiculum vitae to their user page, or link to the branch histories or the review they contributed to.

* Doe, J. Hypertonic saline for bronchiolitis: a living systematic review. Contributions archived at https://github.com/openMetaAnalysis/Hypertonic-Saline-for-Bronchiolitis/commits/gh-pages/ and https://github.com/openMetaAnalysis/Hypertonic-Saline-for-Bronchiolitis/commits/master/

Authors should consider summarizing their edit at http://wikidoc.org and can then cite that edit in the page history at wikidoc. For example:

* Revision by badgettrg: WikiDoc contributors. Bronchiolitis medical therapy. WikiDoc. Nov 9, 2014. Available at: http://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Bronchiolitis_medical_therapy#Hypertonic_saline. Accessed November 9, 2014. Edit isolated in page history: http://www.wikidoc.org/index.php?title=Bronchiolitis_medical_therapy&diff=1047854&oldid=1040638
